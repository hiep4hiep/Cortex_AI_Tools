# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Claude API
## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is an AI technique that combines retrieval of relevant documents with generative models. It works in two main steps:

1. **Retrieval:** The system searches a knowledge base or document store to find information relevant to the user's query.
2. **Generation:** A language model uses the retrieved documents as context to generate a more accurate and informed response.

This approach improves factual accuracy and allows the model to answer questions using up-to-date or domain-specific information.

## Claude API

The Claude API provides access to Anthropic's Claude language models. It allows developers to integrate advanced conversational AI into their applications. Key features include:

- **Text generation:** Generate human-like responses to prompts.
- **Contextual understanding:** Accepts conversation history and external documents for context.
- **Safety controls:** Includes mechanisms to ensure responsible AI usage.

To use the Claude API, you send a prompt (and optional context) to the endpoint, and receive a generated response from the model.

> To use the Claude API, you must create a `.env` file in your project directory and add your own API key.  
> Example:
> ```
> CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
> ```
> Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Claude API key. This ensures secure authentication when making requests to the API.


## Integrating XSIAM Marketplace Content for RAG

To enhance the retrieval capabilities of RAG, content is scraped from the XSIAM Marketplace and stored in a vector database. This process involves:

1. **Scraping:** Extracting relevant data and documentation from XSIAM Marketplace listings.
2. **Indexing:** Converting the scraped content into vector embeddings for efficient similarity search.
3. **Reference:** During RAG queries, the system retrieves context from the indexed XSIAM content, enabling more accurate and domain-specific responses.

This integration ensures that the generative model can reference up-to-date information from XSIAM Marketplace, improving the relevance and quality of answers.
