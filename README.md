## Overview

This application consists of three modules, each leveraging AI Agents to streamline security data operations:

1. **XSIAM Data Model Generator**  
   Utilizes AI to automatically generate data models tailored for XSIAM environments.

2. **Data Source Ingestion Design Document Builder**  
   Employs AI to create comprehensive design documents for ingesting data sources efficiently.

3. **Splunk to Cortex XQL Query Converter**  
   Uses AI to translate Splunk queries into Cortex XQL queries, simplifying migration and interoperability.

Each module is designed to accelerate and automate complex security data workflows.
